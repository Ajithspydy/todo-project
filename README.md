##todo project
##Abstract:
A todo list is a simple and useful application that helps users manage their daily tasks and responsibilities. It allows users to create, prioritize, and organize their tasks in a single place, ensuring that they don't forget anything important. In this project, we will develop a todo list application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application will allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks, set due dates and reminders, and categorize tasks into different lists.

##Software Request:
To develop a todo list application using the MERN stack, you will need to install the following software:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

MongoDB: A NoSQL document-oriented database that allows you to store and manage data.

Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that allows you to create web applications.

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Once you have installed the necessary software, you can start developing the application by creating a new React.js application using the create-react-app command. You can then create the backend using Node.js and Express.js, and connect it to the MongoDB database. Finally, you can create the front-end user interface using React.js and integrate it with the backend API to allow users to interact with the application.
